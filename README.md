# Food Resources / Meal Sites

This app is a resource meant to display locations providing food-related services to the community. Locations are shown as items in a list and/or as markers on a map. A print-friendly view is available as well.

Locations can be filtered according to characteristics such as geography, when open, or service provided.

## Data

Information about all locations is maintained in a Google Sheet. This data is replicated and then published via ESRI REST services.

## Code

This app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

## Map

This app uses the [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) and [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) libraries to manipulate an instance of [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
